// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// tree-walk.mjs — THE ONE DIRECTORY LISTING. Every guard in tooling/ci reads a
// directory through `listDir`, and nothing in tooling/ci imports `readdirSync`.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE RULE, STATED ONCE HERE AND ENFORCED BY assert-walks-bounded.mjs:
//
//   A directory entry is NOT part of the tree under test if
//     · it is a directory that itself contains a `.git` entry — file OR
//       directory — i.e. it is the root of a NESTED CHECKOUT: a git worktree, a
//       submodule, or a stray clone; or
//     · it is named `.claude`, which is gitignored agent scratch space and is
//       where this repository puts every agent worktree.
//
//   The ROOT of the walk is never itself a candidate for exclusion — only
//   entries found INSIDE it are — so pointing a guard at a checkout (which the
//   real repository always is) still scans it in full.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Reproduced on `main` 2026-08-02: with agent worktrees
// present under `.claude/worktrees/` — which this repo creates constantly, one
// per agent task — `node tooling/ci/assert-ops-register.mjs` exited 1 with
// sixteen problems, every one of the form
//
//     .claude/worktrees/agent-<id>/services/platform/wrangler.jsonc declares
//     `triggers.crons` and has no `duty` row …
//
// The guard was walking into NESTED FULL COPIES OF THE REPOSITORY and reading
// their files as if they were the tree's own. CI never sees this, because CI
// checks out one tree and creates no worktrees — so the guard was GREEN IN CI
// AND RED ON A DEVELOPER MACHINE, which is the worst shape a check can take: it
// cries wolf exactly where a human is watching, and the rational response is to
// stop believing it. A guard nobody believes has already stopped guarding.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THE RULE IS `.git`, NOT A HARDCODED `.claude/worktrees/`. The path is an
// accident of this repo's agent harness; the PROPERTY is that the directory is a
// different checkout. Anchoring on the path would leave `git worktree add
// ../wt-probe`-into-the-tree, submodules and stray clones all still wrong, and
// would have to be re-fixed the next time the harness changed its layout.
// `.claude` is skipped IN ADDITION, by name, because it is gitignored scratch
// space that is never part of the tree under test whether or not it happens to
// contain a checkout today.
//
// ⚠️ WHY A SHARED LISTING RATHER THAN N INDEPENDENT FIXES. Five guards were
// descending on the day this was written, and the other thirty-odd walks were
// one refactor away from joining them — the class is reintroduced by writing a
// perfectly ordinary `readdirSync` recursion, which is what every one of them
// already was. So the fix is not "skip nested checkouts in the five": it is that
// no guard enumerates a directory itself any more. `assert-walks-bounded.mjs`
// enforces that as an IMPORT-LEVEL rule — exact and lexical, with no JavaScript
// parsing to get subtly wrong — and it PROVES this file still refuses by
// building a nested checkout in a temp directory and calling `listDir` on it.
//
// Not a guard: it scans nothing of its own, exactly like text-reductions.mjs,
// and is recorded in assert-guard-coverage.mjs's NOT_A_SCANNER for that reason.
// The "did my scan still reach the tree" question belongs to the importers, each
// of which carries its own self-check over what it reads. (As in
// text-reductions.mjs, the marker phrase that check looks for is deliberately
// not spelled out anywhere in this file: it is matched as raw text, so a comment
// ABOUT the marker would claim a self-check this module does not have — prose
// satisfying a check, one level up from the defect this file exists to prevent.)
