/// The SAME-APP upgrade card — [research/44 §7 rung 3].

/// card promotes the app the user is already inside. Google Play's third
/// ads-declaration trigger — the one that needs no SDK — is worded *"House ads:
/// My app renders a small ad banner, interstitial ad, ad wall, and/or widget"*
/// **to promote my other apps**, and this matches none of the three, so no ads
/// label and no "Contains ads" badge follow from it (research/44 V2). The
/// cross-app version is a SEPARATE component with a SEPARATE config key,
/// deferred until app #2 exists (rung 6); the two may never share a widget or a
/// flag, because their declaration consequences differ.
///
/// ## What it reads, and what each read is for
/// * `features.promo_card_enabled` — the on-switch. **Absent reads FALSE**
///   (`AppConfig.feature`'s `orElse`), so a stamped app that has never reached
///   the network shows nothing. This is the state of every app in the portfolio
///   today.
/// * `AppConfig.copy` — the words, so a campaign is a config edit and not a
///   release. Falls back to l10n and **never to the key**: `AppConfig.text`
///   returns the key itself when unset, and a fresh stamp has no overrides, so
///   a purely config-driven card would greet its first user with
///   `promo.card.title`. Same trap, same fix, as the onboarding carousel.
/// * `flags.promo_card_variant` — which wording this install sees, bucketed on
///   the SAME `installIdProvider` value the analytics cohort uses. Two
///   independently minted ids makes every experiment permanently unanalysable.
/// * the rail's `Offering` — the price, DERIVED. There is no price literal in
///   this file and `tooling/ci/assert-no-price-literals.mjs` fails the build if
///   one appears.
/// * `PurchaseRail.canStartCheckout` — whether to offer to sell at all. False
///   on `ios-appstore`, `macos-appstore` and `android-play` (ADR 039 D3 ·
///   research/44 V13), where the card still renders and simply carries no buy
///   button. Steering to an external checkout on those three is a documented
///   rejection cause.
/// * `paywallLockedProvider` — a user who has already paid is not promoted to.
///   The rule the `CatchUpNudgeBanner` beside it established, applied to money:
///   a nudge the user paid to see is not a nudge.
///
/// ## What it deliberately does NOT do
/// **It opens no URL.** The buy control navigates to `/paywall`, which is where
/// the ONE hosted rail lives; every offer link therefore resolves to the apex
/// buy surface (ADR 038) through the merchant of record this portfolio is
/// locked to. A second checkout — a `pay.rev.cat` link, a per-app subdomain,
/// anything this widget launched itself — would be a second merchant of record
/// with its own VAT/GST posture (research/44 V14). `assert-purchase-path.mjs`
/// fails the build if this file grows a launcher.
///
/// **It emits no impression or click event.** research/44 §4.4 is explicit that
/// v1 ships UNMEASURED and that this is the one irreversible decision in the
/// programme: the locked taxonomy carries no cross-promo event, adding one
/// takes a portfolio session-capacity cut of 25–50% against the binding D1
/// rows-written ceiling, and the choice is owner decision D6. So the variant is
/// resolved with the PURE `core.resolveFlag` rather than through
/// `featureFlagsProvider`, whose `ObservedFeatureFlags` wrapper would emit
/// `variant_exposed` on first read. That read is a genuine gap and it is
/// PRINTED on every run by `assert-flag-exposure.mjs` rather than left to be
/// discovered — when D6 says measure, this line moves to the observed reader
/// and the guard's ceiling comes back down.
