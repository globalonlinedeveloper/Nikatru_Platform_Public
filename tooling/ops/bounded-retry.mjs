// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// bounded-retry.mjs — THE ONE READING OF "IS THIS FAILURE A BLIP OR AN OUTAGE?"
// FOR EVERY READER UNDER tooling/ops/.
//
// NOT A GUARD. It scans nothing, reads no file, makes no request and never sets
// an exit code. Pure classification plus one injectable sleep. The COVERAGE LOST
// decision stays with the caller, exactly as it does for text-reductions.mjs and
// capture-suite-scan.mjs: this module answers "ask again?", never "is it fine?".
//
// ── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// 🔴 ONE DROPPED TCP CONNECTION TURNED A WHOLE ops-watch RUN RED (row
// O-PAGES-FETCH-TRANSIENT-NOT-RETRIED). Run 35478397730 read
// `✗ nikatru (git) — TypeError: fetch failed`: 0 RED, 1 NOT JUDGED, exit 2, while
// the other two projects read fine in the SAME run and a dispatch sixteen minutes
// later was green. A red ops-watch reddens `ci-gate` on `main`, so that blip froze
// the merge queue — and it teaches every reader to shrug at an ops-watch red,
// which is how a genuinely red one (eight missed heartbeats) sat unnoticed for
// eight hours the same day.
//
// #852 fixed that ONE reader and said, in its own header, that the class sweep
// wanted a shared `tooling/ops/` retry module. This is that module, and the
// primitives below are #852's, MOVED rather than rewritten: same names, same
// numbers, same semantics. check-pages-deployments.mjs now imports them and
// re-exports them, so the 82 cases it already shipped are the green control for
// the move (MOVED CODE SILENCES GUARDS — the move was proved before the sweep
// that follows it, not assumed).
//
// ── THE MEASURED CLASS, SWEPT 2026-09-21 ────────────────────────────────────
// ELEVEN readers under tooling/ops/ turned a single un-retried `fetch` into a
// run-level verdict with NO retry of any kind — check-heartbeats,
// check-analytics-liveness, status, verify-supabase-templates,
// check-prod-provenance, verify-monitors, verify-alarm-chains,
// verify-auth-providers, check-wildcard-dns, check-turnstile-hosts,
// check-retired-names-live. Two more had a private one:
// check-d1-accepts-live-sql retried ONCE with no gap and only on a transport
// throw (a 429 was final), and verify-free-api-scope had a module-local
// `fetchWithRetry` on a LINEAR gap. record-deployment.mjs exports the policy
// primitives (`RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `isRetryable`, `retryDelayMs`) but no wrapper,
// and its policy is GitHub-shaped: it deliberately EXCLUDES 429, which for the
// Cloudflare API is exactly the "ask again" case. So it is not the home for this,
// and this module does not shadow its exports with different meanings.
//
// 🔴 `status.mjs` WAS THE WORST SHAPED, AND ITS DEFECT WAS THE VERDICT, NOT THE
// RETRY. `probeLive` turned EVERY transport failure into `{ error }`, which
// `evaluateSurface` reds as `unreachable`, which exits 1 — "I LOOKED, IT IS
// BROKEN". A DNS blip on the runner therefore accused a healthy surface of being
// down. Un-reached is not the same claim as broken, and this repo already spends
// a whole exit code on the difference.
//
// ── THE THREE-VALUED CONTRACT THIS MODULE SERVES ────────────────────────────
//   0  green       · 1  a finding (it really is wrong) · 2  COVERAGE LOST
// A failure that outlives the plan STAYS at the caller's COVERAGE LOST. The
// retry distinguishes a blip from an outage; it forgives neither. Swallowing a
// persistent failure into a pass would turn a real vendor outage into a green
// sweep, which is strictly worse than the false red this module exists to remove.
//
// ── THE NUMBERS, AND WHY EACH ONE IS THAT NUMBER ────────────────────────────
// Every constant here is JUDGEMENT recorded as judgement. None is a vendor SLA
// and none may be cited as one.
//
//   READ_ATTEMPTS = 3, RETRY_BASE_MS = 1000  →  gaps of 1 s then 2 s, so
//   RETRY_CEILING_MS = 3 s of waiting per read. The measured defect is ONE
//   dropped connection, which needs one more try and not six. #852's numbers,
//   unchanged, so adopting this module cannot move the behaviour that row proved.
//
//   RETRY_AFTER_CEILING_MS = 5000. A server that sends `Retry-After` has told us
//   when it will answer; asking sooner burns an attempt on a refusal it already
//   announced. But an honoured header is an UNBOUNDED wait unless it is clamped,
//   and the arithmetic has to fit the smallest job in ops-watch.yml, which is
//   `timeout-minutes: 5` (300 s). The widest fan-out on this lane is status.mjs,
//   which probes one surface per declared hostname at PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS = 10 s
//   each. At ten surfaces the worst case is 10 × 2 gaps × 5 s = 100 s of waiting
//   plus 10 × 10 s = 100 s of probing = 200 s, inside 300 s with margin. At 8 s
//   the same arithmetic reaches 260 s, which is inside the timeout but not inside
//   it with room to be wrong about the surface count.
//   ⏱ APPENDED 2026-09-22 (row O-OPS-READER-NO-CEILING): the `timeout-minutes: 5`
//   job above is `alert`, which runs no reader. Every job that runs a reader is
//   `timeout-minutes: 10` (600 s), and the sum that has to fit it is the one in
//   "THE PER-REQUEST CEILING" below, not this one. The 5 s clamp is unchanged.
//   ⏱ APPENDED 2026-09-25 (row O-OPS-PROBE-US-EDGE-STALL): status.mjs now adds
//   ONE second look, run IN PARALLEL over the surfaces its sweep left unreached,
//   so it adds one second look's wall clock, not one per surface. Its worst case
//   is DERIVED in status.mjs (`statusWorstCaseMs`) from these constants:
//   N × (3 × 10 s + RETRY_WALL_CEILING_MS 10 s) + secondLookWallMs(10 s) 85 s
//   = 11 × 40 s + 85 s = 525 s for the 11 surfaces probed on 2026-09-25, inside
//   the status job's `timeout-minutes: 10` (600 s) with 75 s to spare.
//   ops-status.test.mjs case (d) re-derives it from the live register and the
//   workflow on every run. See "THE SECOND LOOK" below.
//
//   REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS = 15 000. The longest ONE attempt may take, armed HERE
//   and not in each reader (see "THE PER-REQUEST CEILING"). 15 s is the ceiling
//   this repository already uses for one request in assert-ops-register.mjs,
//   assert-alert-disposition.mjs and post-deploy-smoke.mjs, so it is not a new
//   number; it is the one number moved to where every reader inherits it.
//
//   READ_WALL_CEILING_MS is DERIVED: attempts × REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS +
//   RETRY_WALL_CEILING_MS = 3 × 15 s + 10 s = 55 s, the most wall clock ONE read
//   may spend in total when every attempt hangs to the ceiling and the server
//   asks for the longest wait on every gap.
//
//   RETRY_WALL_CEILING_MS is DERIVED, never typed: (attempts − 1) ×
//   RETRY_AFTER_CEILING_MS — the most wall-clock ONE read may spend waiting even
//   when the server asks for longer on every gap. A hand-copied ceiling is the
//   number that drifts away from the loop it claims to describe, which is why
//   RETRY_CEILING_MS is SUMMED from backoffPlan() too.
//
// ── WHAT IS RE-ASKED, AND WHAT IS AN ANSWER ─────────────────────────────────
// RETRYABLE: the transport failing outright (`TypeError: fetch failed`,
// ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT, ENOTFOUND, EAI_AGAIN, ECONNREFUSED, EPIPE, an aborted
// request), HTTP 429, HTTP 5xx.
// AN ANSWER, failed on first sight: every other 4xx — a 401/403 is a revoked
// token and does not improve in two seconds, and re-asking a 404 only spends the
// ceiling — plus unparseable JSON, `success: false`, a missing credential, and
// every programming error a reader could throw. Three identical lines in the log
// are not evidence of anything.
//
// ── THE PER-REQUEST CEILING (row O-OPS-READER-NO-CEILING, 2026-09-22) ────────
// 🔴 A RETRY BOUNDS THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS, NOT THE LENGTH OF ONE. Twelve
// fetch sites in ten ops-watch readers passed no signal, so a vendor that
// accepted the connection and never answered held the attempt until the JOB's
// timeout cancelled it — and a cancelled job reports nothing at all, which is
// the silent failure this module exists to remove.
//
// So the ceiling lives in `readWithBoundedRetry`, once: a FRESH ceiling per
// attempt (an aborted signal stays aborted, so one hoisted above the loop would
// fail every retry instantly). `attemptWithCeiling` gives each attempt its own
// `AbortController`, aborted by a ref'd `setTimeout` and not by
// `AbortSignal.timeout` (why ref'd: the note on that function), and combines it
// with the caller's own signal through `AbortSignal.any`, never replacing it.
// ⏱ CORRECTED 2026-09-24: this paragraph said `AbortSignal.timeout`; the code
// under it is the ref'd timer. The read receives the combined signal as
// `read(attempt, { signal })` and passes it to its fetch.
// The attempt is also RACED against that signal, so a read that forgets to pass
// it still ends: its timeout is a transient look, retried, and then COULD NOT
// LOOK (exit 2), exactly like a dropped connection. A caller's own abort is not
// ours to retry, so it ends the loop at once with the caller's reason.
//
// A reader may pass `timeoutMs` to SHORTEN the ceiling (status.mjs keeps its
// 10 s for its fan-out arithmetic); nothing may lengthen it. The env knob
// OPS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS exists for the behavioural tests and may only shorten
// it too (`Math.min`), on the VERIFY_FREE_API_SCOPE_RETRY_MS precedent — a knob
// that could raise it would be a way to switch the ceiling off from outside.
//
// The sum that has to fit: every reader job in ops-watch.yml is
// `timeout-minutes: 10` (600 s), and one read costs at most READ_WALL_CEILING_MS
// (55 s). Ten sequential reads that ALL hang already reach 550 s, and the
// heartbeats job (check-d1-accepts-live-sql reads once per statement per
// database) and the glitchtip job (seven readers in one job) run more than ten.
// So the job ceiling alone cannot guarantee that a later reader in the same job
// runs after an outage. ⏱ CORRECTED 2026-09-24: this said each reader STEP
// carries its own `timeout-minutes`. Measured in ops-watch.yml, it is set per
// JOB, on nine lines (the `alert` job's 5, every other job's 10), and on no
// step. A job whose reads all hang can therefore reach its 10 minutes and be
// cancelled, and the readers after the hung one in that job do not run. A
// per-step `timeout-minutes` on each reader step is a named follow-on of row
// O-OPS-READER-NO-CEILING.
//
// 🔴 CLASSIFICATION IS MARKED AT THE THROW SITE, NEVER INFERRED FROM A MESSAGE.
// `transientLook()` sets the flag; `isTransientLook()` reads it. A future branch
// therefore has to DECIDE which of the two a new failure is, rather than having
// a substring match decide for it — and a message this module never wrote can
// never be mistaken for a promise to retry.
//
// 🔴 ONLY SAFE METHODS ARE RE-ASKED BY DEFAULT. `isSafeMethod` exists because
// verify-alarm-chains.mjs shares one `api()` between its GET reads and the PUT
// its --self-test uses to break and restore a live alert. Re-sending a write
// whose response was lost is a different decision from re-asking a read, and it
// is not this module's to make silently.

// ⏱ 2026-09-25 — THE SECOND LOOK (row O-OPS-PROBE-US-EDGE-STALL).
//
// 🔴 THE FIRST PASS IS TOO SHORT TO OUTLAST ONE STALL AT THE CLOUDFLARE EDGE. The
// Box B hostnames are served by a Cloudflare Tunnel whose connectors sit in
// Mumbai (colos bom06/bom09/bom10). A GitHub runner reaches them through a US
// edge, and some US-edge requests STALL: the edge never gets an answer from the
// tunnel, the client gives up, and Cloudflare logs edgeResponseStatus 499 with
// originResponseStatus 0. cloudflared logs nothing, because the request never
// reached it. 03:01-08:44Z on 2026-09-25 that was 35 stalls in about 1,300
// requests, all at US colos (PDX 23, MSP 10, SJC 1, SEA 1), against 0 in 1,056 at
// Indian colos; 22-24 Sep, about 100, all at US colos. status.mjs spent its three
// attempts in about 33 s (10 s each, 1 s and 2 s apart), all three landed in one
// stall, and ops-watch went red with NOTHING ANSWERED three times while the box
// was up (runs 35996417635, 36110724525, 36113462303).
//
// So a caller may opt in (`secondLook: true`, or `secondLook()` directly) to ONE
// more, time-spread look after its first pass is exhausted: SECOND_LOOK_ATTEMPTS
// attempts, SECOND_LOOK_GAP_MS apart, each under the same per-request ceiling.
//   · An ANSWER on the second look is graded exactly like a first-pass answer.
//   · Nothing on the second look is still COULD NOT LOOK. Never a silent green.
//   · It is never silent when it helped: the caller's `slowPath` line prints
//     (default `console.warn`), because a run that needed it is evidence that
//     the path is degrading, even when the verdict is green.
//
// ⚠️ EACH SECOND-LOOK ATTEMPT OPENS A NEW CONNECTION — measured 2026-09-25 on Node
// v24.18.0 against a 127.0.0.1 server that holds the first requests unanswered.
// An attempt this module aborts has its socket DESTROYED: attempts 1 and 3 each
// arrived on a fresh connection. That matters because Cloudflare picks the edge
// per connection: in run 36113462303 one glitchtip attempt hit MSP (499) and the
// next hit ORD (200). THE ONE EXCEPTION, also measured: an idle keep-alive socket
// left by an EARLIER ANSWERED request to the same origin IS reused (attempt 2
// went out on the warm-up's socket). status.mjs's second look only re-asks a
// surface that never answered in this process, so it holds no such socket.
//
// THE NUMBERS. SECOND_LOOK_ATTEMPTS = 4 and SECOND_LOOK_GAP_MS = 15 000 are
// judgement: four looks spread over about a minute and a half, on top of the
// first pass's half a minute, outlast every stall in the evidence without
// Argo Smart Routing (a spend, owner-gated) or opening Box B ports (a security
// change). The wall clock one second look may take is DERIVED
// (`secondLookWallMs`): attempts × the ceiling + (attempts − 1) × the gap —
// 4 × 15 s + 3 × 15 s = 105 s at REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS, 4 × 10 s + 3 × 15 s = 85 s
// at status.mjs's PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS. The gap is FIXED, not doubled and not
// clamped by RETRY_AFTER_CEILING_MS: spreading the looks in time is the whole
// point, and a 5 s clamp would silently fold them back into one stall.
// OPS_SECOND_LOOK_GAP_MS is the test-only knob, and like OPS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS
// it may only SHORTEN the gap.
